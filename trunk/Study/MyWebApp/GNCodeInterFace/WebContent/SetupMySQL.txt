This soft link will help during installation of PHP wen you use the --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql 
in configure option

# cp support-files/my-small.cnf /etc/my.cnf
# chown root /etc/my.cnf
# chgrp root /etc/my.cnf
# chmod 644 /etc/my.cnf

# vi /etc/my.cnf

Search for [mysqld] clause, and add immediately below it:
user = mysql

If you want to use InnoDB databases (what you probably will), uncomment (and perhaps edit) all innodb options in the my.cnf file. Save all changes ( :wq).
additional settings

For proper functioning, MySQL needs a "mysql" database. To create this database, simply run:
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql

# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

Hit enter again to get your prompt back. The MySQL server should now be running. To check that server is running and works properly enter
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin version

You should get some response about the server software version.

Connect to MySQL server:
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root

If you get a welcome message and the prompt changes to mysql>, the server works and everything is fine. If this failed for any reason, it may indicate some problems with your installation/configuration.
set the root password

Now, before you do anything else, set root user's password (!). Stay connected to MySQL and enter:
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User = '';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SELECT Host, User FROM mysql.user;

Look for the record that has root in the User column and something other than localhost in the Host column. This is the host_name.
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('new_password');
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'host_name' = PASSWORD('new_password');

After everything is set up, restart MySQL server:
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

Voila, your MySQL server is up and running!
automatic startup

Set up an automatic startup so you don't need to start MySQL server manually after each system reboot. Go back to the directory where you extracted the downloaded mysql tarball file. Enter
# cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql
# chmod 755 /etc/init.d/mysql
# chkconfig --add mysql
# chkconfig --level 35 mysql on 

/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
